<h1>Sale generator and excel formatter</h1>

**Note: create a virtual environment to test it**

It's a simple tool to generate sample sale and also to format excel sheets for now it can only format GSTR-2A and GSTR-2B data downloaded from Compuoffice software

To try it out run

```
mkdir files
mkdir output
python main.py
```
If you want to try formatter function a sample file is stored in sample folder, just copy it into files folder.

a window with two options will appear:
- Sale generator
- Excel formatter

choose whatever option you want to try

key notes:
- Flet is in early stage
- 2B formatting needs to be fixed
- There are many bugs needs to be fixed

Just tweak some code if something is not working.

here is the flet documentation link :
